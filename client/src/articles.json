    "ingredients": [
      "1 free-range turkey (ideally Norfolk Black or Bronze), about 5–5.5kg",
      "Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper",
      "2 onions, peeled and halved",
      "1 lemon, halved",
      "1 head of garlic, halved horizontally",
      "6 bay leaves",
      "Olive oil to drizzle",
      "8 rashers of smoked streaky bacon"
    ],
    "steps": [
      "Preheat the oven to 220°C/Gas 7. Meanwhile, prepare the herb butter. Put the butter into a large bowl and season with salt and pepper. Add the olive oil and mix well. Add the lemon zest and juice, crushed garlic and chopped parsley. Mix well to combine.",

      "Remove the giblets from the turkey cavity. Season the cavity well with salt and pepper, then stuff with the onions, lemon, garlic halves and 2 bay leaves.",
      "With your hands, loosen the skin on the breast from both ends of the bird so that you will be able to stuff the flavoured butter underneath it, making sure you keep the skin intact. Repeat with the skin on the legs – from the lower side of the breast feel your way under the skin and out towards the leg, loosening the gap.",
      "Stuff half the butter mix into the opened spaces under the skin. From the outside of the skin, gently massage the butter around the breasts so that the meat is evenly covered. Finally, insert the rest of the bay leaves under the skin of the breasts.",
      "Place the bird in a large roasting tray, breast side up. Spread the rest of the butter all over the skin. Season well with salt and pepper, then drizzle with a little olive oil. (If preparing a day ahead, cover the turkey with foil and refrigerate at this stage.)",
      "Roast the turkey in the hot oven for 10–15 minutes. Take the tray out of the oven, baste the bird with the pan juices and lay the bacon rashers over the breast to keep it moist. Baste again. Lower the setting to 180°C/Gas 4 and cook for about 2 1⁄2 hours (calculating at 30 minutes per kg), basting occasionally.",
      "To test whether your turkey is cooked, insert a skewer into the thickest part of the leg and check that the juices are running clear, rather than pink. As oven temperatures and turkey shapes and sizes vary, it is crucial to check your turkey about 30 minutes before the calculated roasting time. If the juices are pink, roast for another 15 minutes and check again. Repeat as necessary until the turkey is cooked.",
      "Transfer the turkey to a warmed platter and remove the parson’s nose, wings and tips of the drumsticks; reserve these for the gravy. Leave the turkey to rest in a warm place for at least 45 minutes; make the gravy in the meantime. Remove the bay leaves from under the skin before carving."

    "dish": "Korean Fried Chicken",
    "ingredients": [
      "FOR THE MARINADE",
      "1 cup roasted chili oil",
      "¼ cup kosher salt",
      "1 tablespoon medium/fine gochugaru (ground Korean red pepper)",
      "FOR THE CHICKEN",
      "4 pounds chicken legs, separated into thighs and drumsticks",
      "About 4 quarts peanut or soy oil, for frying",
      "1 cup potato starch or tapioca starch",
      "FOR THE SAUCE",
      "1 cup gochujang (fermented Korean pepper paste)",
      "8 garlic cloves",
      "½ cup pure maple syrup",
      "1 tablespoon soy sauce",
      "2 teaspoons fish sauce",
      "¼ cup cheongju (Korean rice wine)",
      "¼ cup Frank’s RedHot sauce",
      "2 teaspoons MSG (optional but recommended)"
    ],
    "steps": [
      "Deep-fry or candy thermometer",
      "2 sheet pans lined with newspape",
      "2 cooling racks, each approximately the same size as the sheet pans",
      "Food processor or immersion blender",
      "In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the chili oil, salt, and gochugaru. Add the chicken and toss to coat with the marinade. Cover and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes and up to an hour.",
      "Add frying oil to a large, deep, straight-sided frying pan (or other vessel suited to frying chicken) so that it is no more than half full. Bring to 300˚F over medium heat, monitoring the temperature with a deep-fry thermometer.",
      "Place the potato starch in a shallow bowl. Working in batches, remove the chicken from the marinade, letting the excess drip off, then toss into the potato starch to coat.",
      "Set the cooling racks over each lined sheet pan",
      "Working in batches, carefully transfer the chicken to the hot oil. Blanch in the oil for 6 to 8 minutes per side, turning the chicken as necessary. The chicken should be opaque looking, and about 75 percent cooked through. (If you’re unsure, cut into a piece of chicken to inspect the doneness from the inside.) Use tongs or a slotted spoon to remove the chicken to the cooling rack, and continue until all of the chicken has been blanched.",
      "Once it is completely cool, transfer the chicken to a clean sheet pan (or remove the rack and discard the newspaper from one pan), wrap it tightly with plastic wrap, and freeze for 8 hours or overnight.",
      "The next day, combine the gochujang, garlic, maple syrup, soy sauce, fish sauce, cheongju, hot sauce, and, if using, the MSG in the food processor and blend well. This is the sauce that you will brush the chicken with as it comes out of its finishing fry.",
      "Pull the chicken from the freezer and unwrap it about 1 hour before cooking.",
      "Add frying oil to your pan or pot so that it is no more than half full. Bring it to 350˚F over medium heat, again monitoring the temperature with the thermometer. Set up your lined sheet pans with the cooling racks. Working in small batches, fry the chicken for 10 to 12 minutes, rotating in the oil as needed, until golden brown. Let drain and cool slightly on the cooling rack, then use a pastry brush to coat each piece with the sauce. Serve with the radish pickles and cold beer."
